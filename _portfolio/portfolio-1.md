One part of my bachelor thesis was the development of an android application to consume beacon signals and map them onto the university rooms. 
Using the application one could get informations about a lecture room on his device, such as upcoming lectures and inventory.
Therefore a complete ecosystem was set up with beacons on lecture rooms, an android application and finally a backend. The backend consists of a Java Server and a MongoDB which holds some relevant informations, extracted from the university network.
